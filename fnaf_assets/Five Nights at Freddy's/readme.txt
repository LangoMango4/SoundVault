Five Nights At Freddy's 

-----------------------------Info--------------------------------

A nice little horror aspect to the ti 84. Copy of the actual Five Nights at Freddy's by Scott Cawthon. This game is on a calculator, and do not expect the same quality game as the original. Please note that these files are EXTREMELY large and will take up a HUGE amount of data, but worth it (hopefully). Recommend using a TI 84 because of the need of processing power and Axe full mode. Now includes an app version for faster and more efficient gameplay. Game is still incomplete, changelog in the readme. Source included. ver 4.2

Also, side note, the text that displays per night will slow down if you view the monitor, because of lag. Just pretend that the power from using the monitor slows down the recording or something :P. 
-------------------------How to Upload---------------------------

The game needs a total of 3 large appvars in archive, all conveniently placed in the folder, Quick upload. 
To install the app version, just drag everything from Quick upload to archive in your calculator. 
If you want to use a shell instead of having it as an app,then send one of the files in the folder, Other shells into RAM or Archive, depending on your favorite shell. 
All source also included in folder. 

------------------------Saving the Game--------------------------

Save file will be stored in FNAFS and should save no matter what. All nights will be auto saved, so don't try to cheat your way to victory. Exiting when in the gameplay will save the info, some time will decrease and energy lost as a result though, minimal.

        ,             (              )
    Backstage    Dining Area     Show Stage
        7                                           x
   Pirate Cove                                  Restrooms
        4             5              6              -
  Supply Closet   West Hall      East Hall       Kitchen
                      2              3
               W. Hall Corner  E. Hall Corner

It might be hard to find out which buttons are which, but it's not that hard to learn! 

-----------------------------Hints-----------------------------
Freddy, Bonnie, and Chica will show a sign when they are halfway to your office, shaking the screen. 
Foxy will shake the screen when he is running and about to kill you. 
Hallucinations for Freddy are not done yet, but it will later signal whether he will attack or not. For now, just do your best :P.

Runer112's grayscale library, very easy to use and no shimmering at all. 
thepenguin77's FULLRENE axiom that allows all memory use. 
Also, I have never actually tested this game before, so feel free for feedback in Cemetech!
